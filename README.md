# Linear-Code

It is a simple program for encoding and decoding a message of any size with a code of any size and dimensions,using the sagemath package.
In the encoding part you can set up a code of any size (n) and dimension (k) and then enter the message you want to encode.
In the decoding part you can decode a message by knowing the generator matrix and then converting the binary message to actual ascii characters
